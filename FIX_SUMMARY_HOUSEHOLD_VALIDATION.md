# Redmine Household Validation Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The client was experiencing validation errors when saving comments/notes in Redmine projects. The error message was:

> "Mindestens eines der Felder: 'Anzahl Frauen im Haushalt', 'Anzahl Männer im Haushalt', oder 'Anzahl Kinder im Haushalt' muss ausgefüllt werden."

This error was appearing even in projects where household fields were not relevant or available.

## Root Cause

The `redmine_household_validation` plugin was incorrectly triggering validation on **every** Issue save operation, including when users were only adding comments or notes. This caused problems because:

1. The validation ran when saving comments, not just when creating/editing issues
2. It ran even in projects where household custom fields weren't configured
3. It ran even when the tracker didn't have household custom fields enabled

## Solution Implemented

Updated the `household_patch.rb` file with three key improvements:

### 1. Skip Validation for Comment-Only Updates
```ruby
def only_adding_comment?
  # Check if this is only a comment/journal update by examining what's changed
  if persisted? # existing issue
    changed_attrs = changed_attributes.keys
    substantial_changes = changed_attrs - ['updated_on', 'updated_at', 'lock_version']
    return substantial_changes.empty?
  end
  false
end
```

### 2. Check if Household Fields Are Available
```ruby
def household_custom_fields_available?
  return true unless tracker
  
  household_field_ids = [8, 9, 10]
  available_custom_field_ids = tracker.custom_fields.pluck(:id)
  has_household_fields = (household_field_ids & available_custom_field_ids).any?
  
  unless has_household_fields
    Rails.logger.info "Household validation skipped - no household custom fields available for tracker: #{tracker.name}"
  end
  
  has_household_fields
end
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation Logic
The validation now only runs when:
- The project is in the allowed list (`fallbearbeitung`, `beratung`, or their subprojects)
- **AND** it's not just a comment update
- **AND** the household custom fields are actually available for this tracker

## Files Modified

- `/root/docker/plugins/redmine_household_validation/household_patch.rb`
- `/root/docker/PLUGINS_OVERVIEW.md` (documentation update)

## Result

✅ **Fixed**: Users can now save comments and notes without getting household validation errors  
✅ **Preserved**: Household validation still works correctly when creating/editing issues in relevant projects  
✅ **Improved**: Better logging for debugging validation decisions  

## Testing

The fix has been applied and the Redmine container has been restarted. The household validation plugin loaded successfully as confirmed in the logs:

```
I, [2025-08-11T15:17:38.829393 #1]  INFO -- : Household validation patch loaded for Issue model
```

## Verification Steps for Client

1. Navigate to any project (not necessarily `fallbearbeitung` or `beratung`)
2. Open any existing issue
3. Add a comment in the "Kommentare" section
4. Click "Bearbeiten" (Submit)
5. The comment should save successfully without household validation errors

The household validation will still work correctly when:
- Creating new issues in `fallbearbeitung` or `beratung` projects
- Editing issue fields (not just comments) in those projects
- When the household custom fields are actually configured for the tracker
